**DeepSecret** is a tool created to help in the design of cell engineering strategies to improve the secretion capacity of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells for the production of biologics. **DeepSecret** leverages the availability of masive amounts of transcriptome data from cells with different secretory phenotypes and trains a neural network that captures the relation between the transcription profile and the secretion potential. **DeepSecret** then generates a list of potential genetic targets for further analysis and/or cell line development.
