# CHOMan

How to run the code:

python turboCHO.py <name_of_RNAseq_file> <secreted_genes_file> <number_of_samples> <output_file>

Example:

name_of_RNAseq_file = results_clean_qnorm.csv
secreted_genes_file = secreted_genes_included.npy
number_of_samples = 10 //This is the number of samples to be picked randomly as templates to perform in-silico overexpressions
output_file = predictions.csv
