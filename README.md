**DeepSecret** is a tool created to help in the design of cell engineering strategies to improve the secretion capacity of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells for the production of biologics. **DeepSecret** leverages the availability of masive amounts of transcriptome data from cells with different secretory phenotypes to train a neural network that captures the relation between the transcription profile and the secretion potential. **DeepSecret** can be used to predict the impact on protein secretion of different cell engineering strategies. DeepSecret was used to compile a list of knock-in genetic targets to increase productivity of CHO cells.
