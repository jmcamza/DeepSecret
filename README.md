**DeepSecret** is a tool created to help in the design of cell engineering strategies to improve the secretion capacity of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells for the production of biologics.  

**DeepSecret** leverages the availability of massive amounts of transcriptome data from cells with different secretory phenotypes to train a neural network that captures the internal logic between the transcription profile and the secretion capacity of the cells. 

**DeepSecret** can be used to predict the impact on protein secretion of different cell engineering strategies, multiknock-ins/outs. 

**DeepSecret** was used to compile a list of knock-in genetic targets to increase productivity of CHO cells.
